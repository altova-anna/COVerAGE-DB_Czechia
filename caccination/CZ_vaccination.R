# comments: As of today (15 Feb 2021) only selected population groups 
# are allowed to get the vaccine. These are people over 80 y.o., medical 
# proffessionals (with the priority of those working with the COVID-19+ patients etc), 
# members of the army helping to handle the pandemic, members of the emergency services, 
# other workers in the critical infrastructure for the pandemic.
# Kids <18 should not be vaccinated (although there are some according to the data)
